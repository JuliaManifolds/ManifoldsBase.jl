    AbstractManifold{ùîΩ}

A type to represent a (Riemannian) manifold.
The [`AbstractManifold`](@ref) is a central type of this interface.
It allows to distinguish different implementations of functions like the [`exp`](@ref)onential and
[`log`](@ref)arithmic map for different manifolds.
Usually, the manifold is the first parameter in any of these functions within `ManifoldsBase.jl`.
Based on these, say ‚Äúelementary‚Äù functions, as the two mentioned above, more general functions are built,
for example the [`shortest_geodesic`](@ref) and the [`geodesic`](@ref).
These should only be overwritten (reimplemented) if for a certain manifold specific, more efficient implementations are possible, that do not just call the elementary functions.

The [`AbstractManifold`] is parametrized by [`AbstractNumbers`](@ref) to distinguish for example
real (‚Ñù) and complex (‚ÑÇ) manifolds.

For subtypes the preferred order of parameters is: size and simple value parameters,
followed by the [`AbstractNumbers`](@ref) `field`, followed by data type parameters,
which might depend on the abstract number field type.

abstract type AbstractManifold{ùîΩ} end

"""
    AbstractManifoldPoint

Type for a point on a manifold.
While an [`AbstractManifold`](@ref) does not necessarily require this
type, for example when it is implemented for `Vector`s or `Matrix` type elements, this type
can be used either

* for more complicated representations,
* semantic verification, or
* when dispatching on different representations of points on a manifold.

Since semantic verification and different representations usually might still only store a
matrix internally, it is possible to use [`@manifold_element_forwards`](@ref) and
[`@default_manifold_fallbacks`](@ref) to reduce implementation overhead.

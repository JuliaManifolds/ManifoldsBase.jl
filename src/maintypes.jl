    AbstractManifold{F}

A manifold type. The `AbstractManifold` is used to dispatch to different functions on a manifold,
usually as the first argument of the function. Examples are the [`exp`](@ref)onential and
[`log`](@ref)arithmic maps as well as more general functions that are built on them like the
[`geodesic`](@ref).

The manifold is parametrized by an [`AbstractNumbers`](@ref) to distinguish for example
real (‚Ñù) and complex (‚ÑÇ) manifolds.

For subtypes the preferred order of parameters is: size and simple value parameters,
followed by the [`AbstractNumbers`](@ref) `field`, followed by data type parameters,
which might depend on the abstract number field type.

"""
    AbstractManifoldPoint

Type for a point on a manifold. While a [`AbstractManifold`](@ref) does not necessarily require this
type, for example when it is implemented for `Vector`s or `Matrix` type elements, this type
can be used either
* for more complicated representations,
* semantic verification, or
* even dispatch for different representations of points on a manifold.

Since semantic verification and different representations usually might still only store a
matrix internally, it is possible to use [`@manifold_element_forwards`](@ref) and
[`@default_manifold_fallbacks`](@ref) to reduce implementation overhead.
